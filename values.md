# Values

*Values inform decisions. These principles guide decisions when paths diverge.*

Good means different things in different moments. Context shapes every judgment.

## Core Value Areas

### [Self](./values-self.md)

Personal growth and inner harmony. Understanding your inner compass.

### [Social](./values-social.md)

Meaningful connections and ethical interactions. Relationship quality determines life quality.

### [Impact](./values-impact.md)

Striving for tangible results and making a difference. Ideas without execution remain fantasies.

## At least try

Pursuing ideals is challenging given our imperfect nature. Progress matters more than flawless execution. Strive to live by values that resonate with you. Yoda was wrong. Life is more than just do or do-not. There is no life without at least trying.

## A quick note on Honesty

Honesty is so often cited as a value that it almost becomes cliche. I think the combination of Courage and Integrity applied to the subject of Honesty covers the positive aspects of the value well. Be brave enough to share your thoughts and feelings, but also be wise enough to keep some words to yourself. Be wary of pathological transparency. It can be a trap. The purpose of honesty is for your Integrity, to be a true version of yourself. Do that and life usually becomes less complicated and more enjoyable.

In the spirit of honesty, note that yes, this site was made with the assistance of AI. The underlying content: thoughts, opinions, and ideas are mine, of course. AI doesn't really have those, but it makes for one hell of a spellchecker and formatting whiz to center divs for me when I'm short on time, and while we're being honest, that's most of the time.
