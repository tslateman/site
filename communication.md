# Communication

There's a lot of good material already out there. I encourage reading better authors before my own wramblings.

## My Take

Do your best to be clear, concise, and direct. You can always add more detail later.

Cut unnecessary words. Add more for clarity. Try to [use the right word](https://twain.lib.virginia.edu/projects/rissetto/offense.html#:~:text=13.%20Use%20the%20right%20word%2C%20not%20its%20second%20cousin.).

Try to listen more. Be honest. Be kind. Be generous. That includes to yourself. Humans are not perfect. Words are hard.

Use tools. Try to use the right ones. Use them well.

Be open as much as possible. Practice. This will help you become a better communicator.
