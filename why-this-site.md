# Why This Site

As I've mentioned before, it's important to [write things down](./write-things-down.md). I want to try elaborating on personal reasons for this site.

## Clarifies Thinking

My thoughts often feel like a jumbled mess. Blame an overactive mind and deficient language skills. Writing them down forces me to commit words to express them, refining them in the process. I have to slow down enought to select the right ones that go together. Through that I form clearer ways to communicate what's in my head. This also checks my understanding. I can catch mistakes and areas I need to do more research and thinking on.

## Written Record

Like many humans, I'm pretty bad at remembering. Writing things down significantly improves my recall, even without needing to refer back to the notes. Of course, eventually, I do need to consult those notes.

The written form is easier to share. By making these public, I push myself to raie the quality bar. This written record also allows me to track the evolution of my thinking. Keeps me accountable.

## Creativity and Reflection

Creativity:

Builds a habit. Creates branches to extend, like nodes on the mind graph to develop.

The overactive mind lights up with seemingly stochastic patterns. This chaotic development of thoughts spurs creative thought, creativity that only counts if I actually write them down to create content.

Reflection:

There's two kinds of reflection going on. There's the immediate one that happens as I write these, where I'm forced to do a reflection on my thoughts and experience to put words down. Then there's the delayed reflection that happens afer a period of time passes and I can review the written record to look back on past writing.
