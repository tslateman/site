*Striving for tangible results and making a difference. Ideas without execution remain fantasies.*

## Achievement & Productivity: Results, Pragmatism, Focus

Achievement is effectiveness, not busyness. Pragmatism asks what actually works. Focus transforms scattered energy into concentrated force.

## Structure & Organization: Order, Efficiency, Accuracy

Order creates supportive systems. Efficiency eliminates waste without sacrificing quality. These skills create foundation for creativity.

## Innovation & Expression: Creativity, Curiosity

Creativity sees new possibilities and makes novel connections. Curiosity drives learning and prevents stagnation. Innovation finds better ways to use existing tools.
