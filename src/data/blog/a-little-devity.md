description: "A poem on brevity: powerful messages poisoned by poor phrasing."
---

Powerful messages are\
Poisoned by poor phrasing.\
Belabor not a good point\
~~with wasteful words~~

Simple as possible\
No simpler\
Concise\
Not cut short

Context with kindness\
No kings nor queens\
Time heals all wounds\
But rots most words

Opinions may divide\
Open minds provide\
Truth though discourse\
In hot takes & cool heads

Solve problems with care\
Mind scars from pain\
Fence Chestertonian\
Hence Smithsonian

Accept current state\
Worry not who's right\
Seek the solution\
In space and time

Humble curiosity\
Lower verbosity\
Kaizen to kanban\
Canaries to Cassandras

Write to the record\
Share to consensus\
Have consideration as\
You mend those fences

Show the work\
Share the knowledge\
Shine and assist\
Decisions with a gist

Plain words\
Not jargon\
Better understood\
Better received

Smart brevity\
Mind the reader\
Respect\
Say less
