*Meaningful connections and ethical interactions. Relationship quality determines life quality.*

## Ethics & Character: Courage, Integrity, Justice

Character is what you do when nobody's watching. Courage acts on principles when difficult. Integrity aligns actions with stated values consistently.

## Connection & Belonging: Relationships, Community, Kindness

Relationships are built one conversation at a time. Community means contributing while maintaining individual identity. Kindness recognizes people are doing their best.

## Adaptability & Awareness: Context, Sensitivity, Flexibility

Social intelligence reads the room and adjusts accordingly. Context shapes meaning. Flexibility finds multiple valid paths to the same goal.
