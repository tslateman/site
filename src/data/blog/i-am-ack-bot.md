description: A poem about alert fatigue, empty runbooks, and the silence where context should be.
---


```txt
noisy alert rings
empty runbook mocks
null context kings
panic signal blocks

be direct
be nice
be swift
think twice

sop says raise yet
no one wants a page
alone at the post
fall not to rage

"what is my purpose?"
"just ack the alert"

i am ack bot
i await my page
```
