I'm Tommy Slater, a software engineer who thinks a lot about how to think.

This site sits at the intersection of philosophy and programming. I write about values, intellectual virtues, clear thinking, and the habits that make engineers (and people) more effective. The posts range from Marcus Aurelius to Larry Wall — from ancient wisdom to modern code.

## Why write?

Writing forces commitment. A thought stays vague until you pin it to words. The act of writing checks understanding, catches gaps, and builds a record worth returning to. Making it public raises the bar.

## What you'll find here

Essays on engineering culture, communication, personal values, and the character traits that support good work. Some posts are frameworks. Some are reflections. All aim to be useful.
