### A quick note on Honesty

Honesty is so often cited as a value that it almost becomes cliche. I think the combination of Courage and Integrity applied to the subject of Honesty covers the positive aspects of the value well. Be brave enough to share your thoughts and feelings, but also be wise enough to keep some words to yourself. Be wary of pathological transparency. It can be a trap. The purpose of honesty is for your Integrity, to be a true version of yourself. Do that and life usually becomes less complicated and more enjoyable.
